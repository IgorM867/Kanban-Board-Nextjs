## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the Kanban board, a popular tool for project management and workflow visualization. It allows users to create boards, add and manage columns, and create tasks with subtasks. The application also features drag-and-drop functionality for both columns and tasks, making it easy to organize and adjust your workflow.

## Features

- Create Boards: Easily create and manage multiple boards for different projects or workflows.
- Add Columns: Customize each board with multiple columns to represent different stages of your workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- Create Tasks: Add tasks to columns with details like titles, descriptions.
- Subtasks: Break down tasks into subtasks to manage more granular aspects of your work.
- Drag and Drop: Move columns and tasks between different stages or reorder them within a column using a drag-and-drop interface.
- Column Reordering: Reorganize columns on a board by dragging them to different positions to adjust your workflow.
- Task Reordering: Change the order of tasks within a column by dragging and dropping them.
- Custom Context Menus for Boards and Tasks
